# Bank-Project
Craeted a package in Java , interface and then implemented the interface and then we tested it in our program Main.java


Project structure : 


com/bankproject/
│── BankAccountInterface.java  ✅ (Interface)
│── BankAccount.java  ✅ (Implements Interface)
│── Main.java  ✅ (Runs the Program)

Understanding software deployement : 

In development, we generally follow this structured approach:
1️⃣ Package 📦 → Groups related classes together for better organization.
2️⃣ Interface 🔌 → Defines a contract (methods) that classes must implement.
3️⃣ Class 🏗️ → Implements the interface or defines its own behavior.
4️⃣ Object 🎭 → Created from a class to use its functionality.

package -- > interface --> class --> object
